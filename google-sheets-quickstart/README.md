# Google Sheets API Quickstart with Python

In this video we will write to a Google Spreadsheet using the Python API. We are authorizing a single user, ourself. For multiple users, the setup is a bit more complicated as you need to store the tokens in the database.

## Instructions

1. You need to create your OAuth app in Google Cloud and download the `credentials.json` file in this project
2. You need create a new spreadsheet in your Google Drive account and replace the value of the constant `SAMPLE_SPREADSHEET_ID` in `main.py` with the ID of your spreadsheet.
